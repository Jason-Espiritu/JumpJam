  - High there! Can you help me climb these platforms?
  - All you  have to do is click anywhere on the screen in order for me to jump.
  - Oh right... Those platforms move.
  - The thing is... these platforms move in sync with the music.
  - You have to time your jump with the music so you can proceed!
  - In other terms,
  - ' click anywhere on the screen when you see the platform moves away from me.'
  - or else I'll bump my head.
  - ...
  - Its not that hard, right? ... Right?
  - ...
  - Anyway let's start now.
  - Click anywhere on the screen if you want to start.

  - High there! Can you help me climb these platforms?
  - All you have to do, is tell me when to Jump.
  - By pressing "Left Click" anywhere on the screen
  - or press the Space Bar.
  - Jumping on the right time will reward you with a point.
  - It will show up on the upper left of the screen called "Score".
  - Beside of that is the "Time"
  - 'The "Time" show us how much time is left. '
  - So we need to reach the top before "Time" runs out.
  - Simple, right?
  - Huh? you don't know when should you tell me to jump?
  - Hmmm... You're right...
  - Oh!... I know...
  - Let's use this "thump" sound as your cue.
  - So whenever you hear this "thump"...
  - '"Jump"'
  - or else my jump will be short and can't go up to the platform..
  - and you lose a point on your "Score"
  - ...
  - Its not that hard, right?
  - Hm? what's that?
  - On the lower left on the Screen?
  - Oh yeah, I almost forgot about that...
  - There are collectibles that we can obtain, once we start jumping.
  - And those will act as Bonus Points for you.
  - ...
  - Anyway let's start now.
  - Just remember to "Jump" when you heard the "thump"

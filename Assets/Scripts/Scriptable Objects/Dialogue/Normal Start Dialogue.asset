  - High there! Can you help me climb these platforms?
  - All you have to do, is tell me when to Jump.
  - By pressing "Left Click" on the screen anywhere on the screen
  - or press the Space Bar.
  - Simple, right?
  - Oh right... Those platforms move.
  - The thing is... these platforms move in sync with the music.
  - You have to time my jump with the music, so we can proceed!
  - In other terms,
  - whenever you see the platform moves away from the center of the screen.
  - '"Jump"'
  - or else I'll bump my head and fall back down.
  - ...
  - Its not that hard, right? ... Right?
  - ...
  - Anyway let's start now.
  - Tell me to jump in order to start.

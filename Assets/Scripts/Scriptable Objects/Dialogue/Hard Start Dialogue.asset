  - Hey! Heyyyy!!!
  - I need your help again! The platforms don't stop anymore.
  - It seems like we can't stop on a platform for too long like we did last time!
  - The music, beat, and everything are the same.
  - only the platforms have changed!
  - Whatever you do, don't stop jumping!
  - ... In sync with the music of course.

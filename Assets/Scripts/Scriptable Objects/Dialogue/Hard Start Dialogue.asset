  - Oh..
  - Hi there, friend.
  - I need your help again.
  - You see... I ran into another problem.
  - Remember this "thump" sound that we always hear?
  - Well now, whenever I start to jump on the first platform.
  - The "thump" sound is now gone, and I can't time my jump anymore.
  - The music, is still the same.
  - Hmmm... Since the "thump" only stops when I start to jump on the first platform.
  - I think we need to memorize the rhythm of this "thump" before we start to jump.
  - So help me climb to the top again my friend.
  - When we start... keep the rhythm of the thumping in your memory.
  - And use that to help me jump at the right time.
  - Let's start...
